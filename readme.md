### Creative Cursing - Python Edition
*Meat muncher! Panty pincher! Butt fungus!*

**Be creative when you hate someone.** Too often we express our blinding rage for one another in trite and clich√©d
ways (stupid head!) You now have endless combinations of uncensored verbal abuse and x-rated comebacks to unleash on your parents, siblings, friends, and enemies alike.
Husband hogging the covers? Boss reprimanding you? Aggressive motorists on the expressway? For the preservation of social harmony everywhere, keep your physical violence at bay and simply run this software for a creative and socially unacceptable insult.<BR>

#### How to use

Make sure all files are in the same folder and navigate to it in a terminal. Then run:
